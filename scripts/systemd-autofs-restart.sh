# This script can be used as a workaround for systemd autofs mount migration.
# The problem is that systemd is a clever guy: before mounting of actual file
# system on top of autofs mount, it first checks that device number of autofs
# mount is equal to the one, stored in sytemd internals. If they do not match,
# systemd ignores kernel request.
# The problem happens each time autofs is restored (new device number for
# autofs superblock) and can't be properly solved without some kind of "device
# namespaces", where device number can be preseved.
# But some of systemd services can be painlessly restarted. Like
# proc-sys-fs-binfmt_misc.
#
# Usage:
# criu restore <options> --action-script $(pwd)/scripts/systemd-autofs-restart.sh
#
